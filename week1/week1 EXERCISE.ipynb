       "Inside the function, we initialize arrays to store the velocity and position at each time step. We then set the initial conditions by setting the initial velocity and position to zero.\n",
       "\n",
       "Next, we simulate the motion of the object over time steps using a for loop. At each time step, we update the velocity and position based on Newton's first law, which states that an object will maintain its state unless acted upon by an external force (in this case, gravity).\n",
       "\n",
       "Finally, we return the updated velocity and position arrays.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the example usage section, we call the `newtons_first_law` function with a mass of 10 kg, an initial velocity of 5 m/s, and a time step of 0.01 s. We then plot the object's position over time using matplotlib to visualize the simulation.\n",
       "\n",
       "This code demonstrates how Newton's first law can be used to simulate the motion of an object under the influence of gravity, showcasing how objects will maintain their state unless acted upon by an external force."
